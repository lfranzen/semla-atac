#' Create Spatial Networks
#'
#' Create spatial networks from spatial coordinates. The spatial networks are provided in a long
#' format which holds information about spot neighbors, their center-to-center distances and positions.
#'
#' @details The default method expects an object of class `tbl` or `data.frame` with four columns
#' "barcode", "x", "y" and "sample" holding the coordinates for a set of spots. The "barcode" column
#' is a character vector with spatial barcodes, "x", "y" hold numeric values representing the spot
#' coordinates and "sample" is a character vector with unique sample IDs.
#'
#' @param object An object (see )
#' @param ... Arguments passed to other methods
#'
#' @return A list of tibbles, each containing information about the nearest neighbors of each spot.
#' For one spot in the column "from", its nearest neighboring spots are provided in the "to" column.
#' Distances correspond to distances between "to" and "from", and usually correspond to H&E image
#' pixels. "numK" defines the number of nearest neighbors for "from" spots selected by `GetSpatialNetwork`.
#' "x_start", "y_start" are the spatial coordinates for "from" spots while "x_end", "y_end" are the
#' spatial coordinates for the neighboring "to" spots.
